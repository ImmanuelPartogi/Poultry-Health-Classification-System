## üîç Overview

ChickenHealthAI is an advanced poultry health monitoring system that leverages artificial intelligence to detect and classify chicken health conditions through fecal image analysis. Using the state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) architecture, the system provides accurate and reliable disease detection for poultry farmers.

The system achieves a remarkable 97.85% accuracy in identifying four critical health conditions:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| üü¢ **Healthy** | Normal healthy condition with no signs of disease |
| üî¥ **Coccidiosis** | Parasitic disease affecting the intestinal tract |
| üü† **Newcastle Disease** | Viral infection impacting respiratory and nervous systems |
| üü£ **Salmonella** | Bacterial infection causing food poisoning and potential health hazards |

Based on the foundational research from DeepPoultryInsight, our model incorporates significant optimizations and architectural enhancements to improve classification accuracy and real-world performance.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

ChickenHealthAI employs a modern client-server architecture optimized for mobile environments:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Mobile User] -->|Takes Photo| B[Flutter App]
    B -->|HTTP Request| C[FastAPI Backend]
    C -->|Image Preprocessing| D[Preprocessed Image]
    D -->|Inference| E[ViT-B/16 Model]
    E -->|Classification| F[Prediction Results]
    F -->|JSON Response| B
    B -->|Display Results| A
    B -->|Save to Local DB| G[Local Storage]
```

### Data Flow
1. User captures chicken fecal image through the Flutter application
2. Image is compressed and sent to the FastAPI backend via REST API
3. Backend preprocesses the image (resizing, normalization)
4. Optimized ViT-B/16 model performs inference on the processed image
5. Classification results with confidence scores are generated
6. Results are returned to the mobile application as a structured JSON response
7. App presents results with visual indicators and stores the record in local history
